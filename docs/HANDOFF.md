## 1. What Happened This Session

This was a long planning/design session, picking up after the previous session's initial
`docs/` scaffolding (spec.md/detailed-spec.md/DECISIONS.md/QA.md, rename to VirtuaLED). No
Android source code exists yet — this session was entirely spec refinement, scope decisions, one
critical architecture correction (validated on real hardware), and MVP implementation planning.

**Scope/monetization discussion** — dev-duration estimates under Pro-plan weekly usage limits;
narrowed test/support device scope to Sharp AQUOS sense9 and FCNT arrows We2 Plus only, Chinese
OEMs explicitly excluded (`docs/DECISIONS.md` §11); donationware distribution model under
consideration (ties into §11's no-universal-compatibility-guarantee stance).

**Feature scope trims** (cost/benefit review, per the "simple but properly cover necessary
features" philosophy, `docs/DECISIONS.md` §8):
- Burn-in reposition interval/style: fixed (4s, instant jump), no settings UI (§13)
- Deep-link tap-to-open + `PendingIntent` holding: cut entirely (§12)
- Replaced by a lighter **peek-preview interaction**: 2-state tap model (Indicator Shown /
  Preview Shown), aggregated text list of all pending notifications, no coordinate hit-testing,
  no `PendingIntent` holding (§14; `docs/detailed-spec.md` §8/§9)
- Blink interval (importance sizing) kept user-configurable, unlike burn-in — individual
  perception differences are a real reason, unlike burn-in's arbitrary cosmetic choice (§15)
- Overlay/session only engages while a notification is pending, and ends itself instantly once
  none remain — no lingering "Idle" state (§16)

**Critical architecture correction (the big one this session)**: the originally-specified
mechanism (raw `WindowManager` `TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY` window, `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW`
permission, session-long `WakeLock`) does not work on devices with a **secure** lock screen
(PIN/pattern/password) — Android blocks that window type above a secure keyguard. Found while
`developer-lite` was drafting the MVP `PLAN.md` files (logged as `docs/QA.md` #14, now resolved).
Researched two comparable real apps (LED Blinker, aodNotify) — both use `AccessibilityService`,
which was rejected here (contradicts this project's own privacy stance, `docs/DECISIONS.md` §3/
§9, and carries heavier Play Store risk). Designed and **validated on real hardware** (a
throwaway prototype, since deleted, tested on arrows We2 Plus / Android 16 / API 36 with a real
PIN lock configured) a corrected mechanism: a full-screen `FakeSleepActivity` using
`setShowWhenLocked(true)` + `setTurnScreenOn(true)`, launched via a full-screen-intent
notification (`USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT` permission — confirmed auto-granted for this project's
sideload distribution). This works universally (secure lock or not) — no hybrid mechanism needed,
and `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` is dropped from the app entirely. Full writeup: `docs/DECISIONS.md`
§18. All of `docs/spec.md` §3, `docs/detailed-spec.md` §1/§2/§8/§14/§15/§16/§17, and the affected
MVP `PLAN.md` files were updated to match.

**MVP implementation planning**: `developer-lite` wrote `PLAN.md` files for all 19
`detailed-spec.md` feature areas, split into `docs/plans/mvp/` (6 features that make up the first
buildable version) and `docs/plans/other/` (9 features/12 files, fully planned but deferred).
After the architecture correction above, 4 of the 6 MVP plans were revised to match. A
`reviewer-lite` cross-consistency pass then found and (I) fixed two real bugs in how the MVP
plans referenced each other (see §3 below for detail) — this is normal pre-implementation
hardening, not a sign anything is untrustworthy.

**Housekeeping**: `.gitignore` created (standard Android patterns; git itself not yet
initialized). The keyguard-test prototype folder and its installed test app were both cleaned up
after validation. `docs/plans/README.md` now documents an "MVP Integration Test" step (a
checklist for testing the whole build end-to-end on a real device once all 6 MVP features are
implemented) and what to do after it passes.

## 2. Current State of the Specs

`docs/spec.md`, `docs/detailed-spec.md` (19 sections), `docs/DECISIONS.md` (18 sections), and
`docs/QA.md` are all internally consistent as of this session's end (numbering/cross-references
verified twice). Read each file's own index first, then jump to the section needed — don't read
end-to-end unless doing another full gap-review pass like this session's.

## 3. MVP Implementation Plans — Ready to Build

`docs/plans/mvp/` contains 6 feature-`PLAN.md` files, in build order (see
`docs/plans/README.md` for the full table + status column, currently all "Not started"):

1. `fake-sleep-overlay` — the corrected `FakeSleepActivity` mechanism
2. `foreground-service-setup` — manifest + FGS declaration
3. `notification-detection-dot-indicator` — `NotificationListenerService` + dot rendering
4. `permission-onboarding` — notification-listener access onboarding only (overlay-permission
   step removed; `USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT` needs no onboarding step, auto-granted)
5. `dismiss-and-peek-interaction` — full peek-preview state model (not simplified)
6. `onoff-notification-toggle` — asymmetric in-app-switch vs. notification-action ON/OFF

A `reviewer-lite` pass caught and I fixed two real cross-plan bugs before implementation: (a)
`dismiss-and-peek-interaction`'s screen-off handler was duplicating `fake-sleep-overlay`'s gating
logic instead of delegating to it, which would have silently bypassed
`onoff-notification-toggle`'s "feature disabled" guard; (b) `FakeSleepActivityHolder` was
referenced by multiple plans as exposing a `FakeSleepSessionController` hand-off, but never
actually declared that field anywhere — added concretely. Two minor/cosmetic findings from that
same review were left as-is (judged non-blocking by the reviewer).

**Known limitation of that review**: it checked cross-file consistency (naming, stale references,
contradictions) — it did not (and structurally could not, as a documentation-only pass) validate
individual code snippets' technical correctness, or lifecycle/threading edge cases. Those can only
surface once code is actually written and run — which is exactly what the MVP Integration Test
(`docs/plans/README.md`, step 7) is for.

`docs/plans/other/` has 9 features (12 files, `auto-stop-conditions` split into 3 sub-plans) fully
planned but deferred — see `docs/plans/README.md` for the list and what each depends on from MVP.

## 4. MVP Build Order Correction (Follow-Up Session)

Before handing the 6 MVP plans to `developer-lite`, the build order in §3 above (and originally in
`docs/plans/README.md`) was checked against each PLAN.md's actual type/method references rather
than taken on faith. It was wrong: the original order built `fake-sleep-overlay` first, but that
plan's own code directly types a constructor parameter as `PendingNotificationsRepository`
(defined in `notification-detection-dot-indicator`) and registers its receiver inside
`VirtuaLedForegroundService.onStartCommand()` (defined in `foreground-service-setup`) — neither
would exist yet at that point in the original order, so it would not compile.

**Corrected MVP build order** (already updated in `docs/plans/README.md`'s table; full dependency
graph and rationale in `docs/DECISIONS.md` §19):

1. `notification-detection-dot-indicator` — no dependencies
2. `foreground-service-setup` — no dependencies
3. `permission-onboarding` — no dependencies (placed here so notification-listener access is
   already grantable by the time device-testable features start, in step 4)
4. `fake-sleep-overlay` — needs 1 and 2
5. `dismiss-and-peek-interaction` — needs 4 and 1
6. `onoff-notification-toggle` — needs 2 and 4

**This is now the build order to follow going forward** — supersedes the order listed in §3 above
and in the earlier `docs/plans/README.md` version. No content within the 6 PLAN.md files themselves
changed; this was a sequencing-only correction.

## 5. Still Open

- **Package name placeholder**: `com.virtualed.app` is used throughout `docs/spec.md` and all
  `PLAN.md` files, still unconfirmed by the user (carried over from before this session).
- **Old `NO-LED` folder cleanup**: `c:\Users\m9112\vscode2\NO-LED` — status not re-checked this
  session; carried over from before.
- **App icon**: interim Material Symbols plan stands, final art deferred (carried over).
- `docs/QA.md` #13 — app-to-indicator-category mapping mechanism (manual vs. auto). Deferred,
  only blocks the (non-MVP) `category-icons-and-assets` feature.
- `docs/QA.md` #15 — whether `phone-call-overlay-suppression`'s explicit
  `CallStateMonitor`/`READ_PHONE_STATE` mechanism is even needed, or whether normal Activity
  lifecycle (an incoming call's own full-screen-intent Activity naturally taking foreground)
  already achieves it for free. Not confirmable from docs alone — needs the same kind of
  real-device prototype validation the keyguard question got (§18), when that (non-MVP) feature
  is picked up.
- Secure-keyguard mechanism (`docs/DECISIONS.md` §18) was validated only on arrows We2 Plus, not
  yet re-confirmed on the Sharp AQUOS sense9 — worth doing opportunistically, not a blocker.

## 6. Recommended Next Step

1. Resolve the package name placeholder (or explicitly decide to keep `com.virtualed.app`).
2. Scaffold the actual Android Studio project (nothing exists in `src/` yet).
3. Have `developer-lite` implement the 6 MVP `PLAN.md` files in the corrected build order (§4
   above), with `reviewer-lite` checking each one as it lands (per
   `~/.claude/shared/dev-workflow.md` §7).
4. Run the MVP Integration Test checklist (`docs/plans/README.md`) on a real device with a
   **secure** lock configured.
5. Once that passes: **tell the user** (don't silently proceed), then start the `other/` tier —
   `reviewer-lite` cross-consistency pass on those `PLAN.md` files first (they reference MVP
   internals that may have shifted during implementation), then implement in any order.
